## 📦 Installing Dependencies

This project uses Node.js for the backend (Express + WebSockets).
All required packages are listed in:

* `package.json`
* `package-lock.json` (automatically generated by npm and included for consistent installs)

You **do not** need to modify or create these files manually.
Simply install dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

npm will automatically:

* Read `package.json`
* Use the versions locked in `package-lock.json`
* Install everything into the `node_modules` folder

If you are cloning this repository for the first time, this is the only setup step required.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 LAN Multiplayer Setup

1. Ensure all players are on the same WiFi/network.
2. Find the host machine’s IP:

   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep inet
   ```
3. Other players connect using:

   ```
   http://<host-ip>:4000
   ```
